# py-reading-and-writing-files

This code read data from a file, find duplicates and write its rows to third file

### How to work with this code:
There is 4 methods in the main.py:
 - `main()` contains code like calling functions and main logic
 - `read_file()` just read file and return data
 - `write_file(data)` just write some data to file
 - `find_special_rows()` find rows with duplicates

### Steps
 1. Create a file in the files directory: `file.txt`
 2. Fill this file. For example:   `1 2 7 5 2 7` and the next row: `19 55 12 66 19 92`
 3. Run `python main.py`
